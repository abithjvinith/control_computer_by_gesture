# control_your_computer_by_gestures
here is my project - you can control your desktop by gesture ( by hands )


At first You need to install anaconda on your desktop 
Download link : https://www.anaconda.com/download


Then open the cmd in anaconda and run the following steps :

step 1 : conda create --name gest python=3.8.5
step 2 : conda activate gest
step 3 : pip install -r requirements.txt
step 4 : conda install PyAudio ( if you needed voice control, otherwise don't need to install it )
step 5 : conda install pywin32
step 6 : Run all the files ( I'm using pycharm )



FACE ANY ERROR :
If you face any error just retry by uninstalling and re-installing again the packages.
